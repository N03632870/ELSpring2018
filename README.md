**Sensor Box** Project

This project's goal was to create a web server that hosts a website that can display temperature and humidity data. This data is collected from a raspberry Pi using a DHT22 sensor. The webserver uses Flask as a framework and the data is stored locally on the server using python and Sqlite3 database. There are currently two raspberry Pi's that read data.
