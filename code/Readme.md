This is where I will put my programs and code.

Temp sensor web assignment:

  readTemperature.py reads the temp sensor attached to the py and adds the data to temperature.db located in the Database folder.

Database folder holds the database created by Web assignment and final project. Initially, the database information should be located within the project folder.
