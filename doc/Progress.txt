Project: Damian Depuy and Nick Ziemis

The project will consist of 2 raspberry Pi's attached with DHT22 sensors that will run a python script to read data at set intervals and store them locally in a DB file. This data will be uploaded to a server where it can be retrieved and displayed via a web page where a user can login and view the details of each box. The project must be able to handle extra box's with minimal set-up.

So far, I have been able to successfully run and test the DHT22 sensor on my pi. 

A template website that is based off a web program assignment has been constructed and will utilize a different database file.

I have acquired an additional Pi that may be used for testing or dedicated server for the website. 


3 week plan.

Data Collection Test:
-use two Pi's and collect an amount of data locally to each pi

Data Transfer Test:
-determine how to collect all the data and where to store it
 -shell.newpaltz.edu is reserved for Damian Depuyy constains *.db     file.
(crontab DB access at different times to avoid traffic to file)

Web Site:
- Determine where and how to store site.
- retrieve data from (shell) that should have data.
