As of 4/25/2018, I have one RPi that acts as a server for a web interface that can query the database with parameters sepcified
by date and time. 

With only two weeks left, I hope to accomplish the following tasks:
-Make my wireless phone network setup more rebust. RPi #1 doesn't always connect on its own.
-Create a chart using either Chart.js or matplotlib instead of just listing data
-Transfer Flask webserver to PC or another RPi and allow it to query RPi #1, or allow RP1 #1 to insert
  into DB file on webserver.
-Set up RPi #2 with DHT22 sensor and accomplish what RPi #1 is doing so webserver can have more than one sensor's data
-Create template files, instructions on easy setup of RPi #3


Successful:
 -RPi #1 reads data from DHT22 with crontab scheduling activated
 -RPi #1 contains webserver that connects to specified network (currently my phone) and allows
   any device on that network to access the web interface
 
Difficulties:
 -Using the school network was not consistant. Sometimes it would work great, while other times it would not connect.
 -There's a bug in the login in code that wasn't appearant and has yet to be determined. Log-in is disabled currently.
 -I was not able to implement as much as I am capable of with this project due to the amount of time spent on hardware issues
   and network problems. 
   
 ** Nick Ziemis was my partner but we were not able to work together for this project **

*Update 5/13/18*
More success: 
 -chart.js used for displaying data works 90%, but there's a bug that does not show the legend data or labels.
 -pi's comm/unicate and access same database where the server and web page is located.
