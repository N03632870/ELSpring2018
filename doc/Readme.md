This directory will hold all the documentation I create for my project.

Initial Progress Report of the Project- Progress.txt

This documentation is a quick guide on how the project was created.

**Parts used:**

..* 1 hdmi cable and mouse/keyboard set for initial installation of OS
..* 2 Debug cables for Raspberry Pi USB to TTL Serial Cables
..* 2 Raspberry Pi 3 eModel B Motherboards each with
..* 2 DHT22/AM2302 Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensors
..* 2 Raspberry Pi case (one black, one clear)
..* 2 400 Points breadboard about 3.2" x 2.1" x 0.3"
..* 8 Jumper wire ribbon cables, male-female ends
..* 4 1/4-watt 200ohm resistors
..* 2 LEDs
   
This documentation assumes reader has some prior knowledge of linux and raspberry pi installation. It is not meant to be a complete tutorial. I will use narration to explain the what I have done up until presentation day.

First Step: Set up two Raspberry Pi's

-1: Using the link: [Installing OS Images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) I used Etcher to burn Raspbian to the external MicroSD card.When completed, the card gets inserted into a pi where I can now access it from a monitor using HDMI and plugging in a keyboard and mouse to navigate. 

-2: After the install, I can now either use the debug usb cables to connect to the console directly, or continue using the HDMI setup.

Second Step: Set up sensors
